# Intro to Django routes/endpoints graded classwork 

Endpoints are the most important concept when it comes to backend web services.
Based on the URL you route the request to the proper piece of code to service the request and return a response.

In the Django implementation, you have a default set of endpoints, but can have specific ones for the various applications
that make your overall implementation.

**Exercise 1:
* Create a new Django project using ```django-admin startproject endpoint66_project```
* Add an application using ```python manage.py startapp endpoint66_app```
* Create an ```urls.py``` for your application 
* Import your application ```urls.py``` into your project ```urls.py```


Add the following endpoints and responses:

* ```gogetthegood/``` that returns ```Here you go!``` along with with something that matters to you (e.g. ```Here you go! Matching Socks!```)
* ```happyhappyjoyjoy/``` that returns the whatever that means to you (e.g. ```Ren & Stimpy rocks!```)

CHALLENGE:
Add an endpoint/route that accepts a string as a parameter. Parse out the string and echo back to the User with the text ```I heard you !```
